# Problem 1 - Wine Data

## 1a
```{r}
# set the working directory
setwd("~/Desktop/Stats\ 506/homework/Stats\ 506\ PS1")

# create column names vector
wine_colnames <- c("Class", "Alcohol", "Malic acid", "Ash", "Alcalinity of ash", "Magnesium", "Total phenols", "Flavanoids", 
                   "Nonflavanoid phenols", "Proanthocyanins", "Color intensity", "Hue", "OD280/OD315 of diluted wines", "Proline")

# read in data from wine.data and put it in a data frame
wine <- data.frame(read.csv("wine.data", header = FALSE))
names(wine) <- wine_colnames
```


## 1b
```{r}
#| code-fold: true
# check that number of wines in each class is correct
# 1: 59, 2: 71, 3: 48
class_1 <- wine[wine$Class == 1,]
cat("Number of wines in class 1: ", nrow(class_1), "\n")

class_2 <- wine[wine$Class == 2,]
cat("Number of wines in class 2: ", nrow(class_2), "\n")

class_3 <- wine[wine$Class == 3,]
cat("Number of wines in class 3: ", nrow(class_3), "\n")
```


## 1c
### 1: What is the correlation between alcohol content and color intensity?
```{r}
#| code-fold: true
cat("Correlation: ", cor(wine$Alcohol, wine$`Color intensity`))
```

### 2: Which class has the highest correlation? Which has the lowest?
```{r}
#| code-fold: true
# create correlation matrix and select top triangle values
correlation_matrix <- cor(wine)
upper_triangle <- upper.tri(correlation_matrix)
correlations <- correlation_matrix[upper_triangle]

# find highest and lowest values
highest <- max(correlations)
lowest <- min(correlations)

# find the names of variables with these values
highest_idx <- which(correlation_matrix == highest, arr.ind = TRUE)
lowest_idx <- which(correlation_matrix == lowest, arr.ind = TRUE)

highest_correlation <- colnames(correlation_matrix)[highest_idx]
lowest_correlation <- colnames(correlation_matrix)[lowest_idx]

# only need the first 2 because the matrix is symmetrical
cat("Classes with the highest correlation: ", highest_correlation[1], ", ", highest_correlation[2], "\n")
cat("Classes with the lowest correlation: ", lowest_correlation[1], ", ", lowest_correlation[2], "\n")
```


### 3: What is the alcohol content of the wine with the highest color intensity?
```{r}
#| code-fold: true
# find the wine with highest color intensity
highest_intensity <- max(wine$`Color intensity`)
highest_intensity_wine <- which(wine$`Color intensity` == highest_intensity)

# find the alcohol content of the wine
cat("Alcohol content: ", wine$Alcohol[highest_intensity_wine])
```


### 4: What percentage of wines had a higher content of proanthocyanins compare to ash?
```{r}
#| code-fold: true
# find # wines that have higher content of proanthocyanins compared to ash
higher_pro_wines <- wine[wine$Proanthocyanins > wine$Ash,]
num_pro_wines <- nrow(higher_pro_wines)

# find percentage of wines
total_num_wines <- nrow(wine)
percentage <- (num_pro_wines / total_num_wines) * 100
cat("Percentage of wines: ", percentage, "%")
```
